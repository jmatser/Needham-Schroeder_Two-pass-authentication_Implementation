"""
Usage:
    B.py <encryption_algorithm> <hash_algorithm> <log_level>

This script initiates a server for continuing the process of the Needhamâ€“Schroeder protocol as B for establishing the key with A.
Later on, two-pass mutual authentication based on ISO/IEC 9798-2 is performed.
Finally, the encrypted content is received from A which will be printed in the terminal after decryption.
It uses the specified algorithms for encryption and hashing, with a configurable logging level.

Arguments:
    encryption_algorithm (str): The encryption algorithm to use. Can be either 'ascon' or 'chacha'.
    hash_algorithm (str):       The hashing algorithm to use for generating and comparing hashes. Can be either 'ascon' or 'sha256'.
    log_level (int):            An integer from 0 to 4, where 0 represents basic logging and 4 represents the most detailed logging available.

Examples:
    Launch the server using Ascon for both encryption and hashing with medium logging:
        $ python3 B.py ascon ascon 2

    Launch the server using ChaCha for encryption, SHA-256 for hashing, and minimal logging:
        $ python3 B.py chacha sha256 0
